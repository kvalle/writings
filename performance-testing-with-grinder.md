Get Started Performance Testing Using The Grinder
=================================================

Performance testing is important.
In this blog post we will explain why, introduce you to a tool for testing performance called The Grinder, and take you through five examples which will get you started using Grinder for testing your web application.

The post is based on workshops held at [ROOTS](http://www.rootsconf.no/talks/42) and [FreeTest](http://free-test.org/node/81#2012051009-EspenHalvorsen), and the materials -- slides, tasks and code -- are of course [available on GitHub](https://github.com/kvalle/grinder-workshop).
To get the most out of the examples, you may want to follow along with the materials trying each task on your own, before reading the solutions we present here.


So, Why Should I Test Performance?
----------------------------------

Well, the fact that you are reading this post, and haven't fallen asleep already is a good sign â€“ you obvoiusly at least have a gut feeling that performance testing is important. And we totally agree with you.

There are a few reasons why we think it's important:

**#1: Performance is a feature!**
It really is! Your users will love you, you will earn more money, and unicorns will dance in joy if you focus on performance. Don't belive us? Well, [this guy says the same](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/performance-is-a-feature.html). Don't you belive him either? He created StackOverflow and stuff, so you should! We won't repeat all the examples here, but suffice to say: this stuff matters! Performance really *is* a feature, a damn important one too!

**#2: Bad performance can kill you!**
Literary! Or figuratively, whatever word kids use these days. The daily press really loves a god "*important site* down, users takes to the streets"-story. You definately don't want your site's logo on those demonstation signs! And when you then have to go into rush-mode and try to fix things, bad things can (and according to mr. Murphy, often does) happen. That's when Kenneth36 and all those nasty things happens! So you definately want to test performance yourself, and don't leave that task to your users on release-day.

**#3: It's good for your health!**
[Some guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._James_Harrington) (with lots of gray hairs, that's how you know he's a smart one) once uttered this brilliant quote:

> Measurement is the first step that leads to control and eventually to improvement.
> If you can't measure something, you can't understand it. If you can't understand it, you can't control it.
> If you can't control it, you can't improve it.

In the end, performance testing really boils down to the basic task of caring about what you do.
You unit test your code, sweat over small details in your user interface, and even care about *how* you work (Scrum, Kanban and all that stuff).
Why shouldn't you take the same pride in your product's ability to actually serve your users, and don't fall down when everyone and their grandmas come knocking.
Well, we think you should!

Enough about that, now that you are properly motivated, we'll put on our "serious-glasses" and start doing some real work:

Why Grinder?
------------

Okay, you get it already, performance testing is important!
But why should you use Grinder in particular?
And what is Grinder anyway?
Lets have a closer look.

Grinder is a load testing framework written in Java.
It is free, open source under a BSD-style licence, and supports large scale testing using distributed load injector machinces.
The main selling point of Grinder, however, is that it is lightweight and easy to use.
With Grinder there are no licences to buy or large environments to set up.
You just write a simple test script and fire up the grinder.jar file.

The reason you, as a developer, will prefer Grinder is that you create your tests in code, not some GUI.
Although Grinder itself is written in Java, the test scripts are written in Jython or Closure, which means you can utilize the expressiveness of a dynamic or functional language while still tapping into the resources of Java and the JVM.
(Of course, should you be so unfortunate not to be a developer, then Grinder might not be the tool for you. But you still need to understand why your developers want and should use Grinder!)

So, lets have a closer look on the nuts and bolts of Grinder.


Grinder 101
-----------

The Grinder framework is comprised of three types of processes (or programs):

1. *Worker processes*: Interprets test scripts and performs the tests using a number of parallel *worker threads*.
1. *Agent processes*: Long running process that starts and stops worker processes as required.
1. *The Console*: Coordinates agent processes, and collates and displays statistics.

![Overview of the Grinder framework](https://raw.github.com/kvalle/grinder-bloggpost/master/images/grinder-overview.png)

In this tutorial we'll keep things simple, and focus on the worker and agent precesses.
We will start an agent process manually, providing it with a test script and configuration, leaving the console and distributed testing out for now.

The test script is simply a Python (or Clojure) source file.
Grinder expects to find a class called `TestRunner` which should implement two methods: `__init__` and `__call__`.
The init-method is called by Grinder initially to set up the test, and call-method is then called repeatedly for each iteration of the testing.

### A Simple Example

Consider the code below.
This is the Grinder-equivalent of a "Hello World" program.
It defines a test script which will print the thread number of the worker thread and the string "hello world" each time it is triggered.

```python
from net.grinder.script.Grinder import grinder
from net.grinder.script import Test

# defining a simple "hello world" function, in order to have something to test
def hello_world():
    thread = grinder.getThreadNumber()
    print '> worker thread %d: hello world!' % thread

class TestRunner:

    def __init__(self):
        # creating a Grinder test object
        test = Test(1, "saying hello")
        # creating a proxy, by wrapping the hello world function with our Test-object
        self.wrapped_hello = test.wrap(hello_world)

    def __call__(self):
        # calling "hello world" through the wrapped function
        self.wrapped_hello()
```

The important part to note in the above code is the `Test` object.
This object represents a basic operation of testing with Grinder.
We wrap our `hello_world` function with the test object, which tells Grinder to start timing and recording it.
Notice also that we are calling Grinder's wrapped version, not the function itself.

Next we need a test configuration.

    grinder.script = hello.py

    grinder.processes = 1
    grinder.threads = 4
    grinder.runs = 5

    grinder.useConsole = false
    grinder.logDirectory = log

Here we first tells Grinder which test script to run.
Then we specify that we only want one worker process started, and that the worker process should initiate four threads, each making five runs, i.e. calls to our `__call__` method.
The final two lines tell Grinder not to expect us to use the console (thus avoiding some output warnings) and where to put the log files describing the test results.

Now we are ready to run the test.
Start Grinder using the following command:

    java -cp lib/grinder.jar net.grinder.Grinder hello.properties

Or, more conveniently by using the [startAgent script](https://github.com/kvalle/grinder-workshop):

    ./startAgent.sh hello.properties

This should result in the printing of "hello world" a number of times and produce some files in the `log` directory.
The `data_xyz.log` file contains a detailed summary of the test events, while the `out_xyz.log` file provides a summary of the results.

             Tests    Errors   Mean Test    Test Time    TPS
                               Time (ms)    Standard
                                            Deviation
                                            (ms)

    Test 1   20       0        0.90         3.05         625.00    "saying hello"

    Totals   20       0        0.90         3.05         625.00


Bootstrapping the Framework
---------------------------

**TL;DR:** run this command `git clone git://github.com/kvalle/grinder-workshop.git; cd grinder-workshop; ./startAgent.sh example/scenario.properties`

**A bit more detailed:**

What you need to do is:

- Make sure you have [git](http://git-scm.com/download) installed
- Make sure you have [Java](http://java.com/en/download) installed
- Check out the repository containing the examples from the workshop

    `git clone git://github.com/kvalle/grinder-workshop.git`

When you are finished with these simple steps, you can check that everything works by running the sample test (which we described in the last section):

    cd grinder-workshop
    ./startAgent.sh example/scenario.properties

When you run this example, Grinder will output some information.
First there will be some information about what happens during the start-up of Grinder, and then some lines of 'hello world' while running the test script.
This should look something like the following:

    > worker thread 2: hello world!
    > worker thread 0: hello world!
    > worker thread 1: hello world!
    > worker thread 3: hello world!
    ...

When the test has finished running, you can also check that everything is okay by inspection the results that have been stored in the newly created directory `grinder-workshop/log`.
It should be two files with names like `out_xyz-0.log` and `data_xyz-0.log` where `xyz` is the name of your computer.
The `out`-file contains a summary of the test results, and the `data`file contains all the details in a comma-separated format.
If everything ran smoothly there should *not* be any files with names like `error_xyz-0.log`!

*If you for some weird reason can't install git it is also possible to download [the code as zip file](https://github.com/kvalle/grinder-workshop/zipball/master).*


Example 1 - Testing GET Response Time
-------------------------------------

In the first example, we will start easy by writing a test which makes a HTTP GET request for a single URL, and measure the response time.

First, we need some setup.
Like in the "hello world" example, we start with a simple configuration file in `1.properties`.

    grinder.script = scripts/task1.py

    grinder.processes = 1
    grinder.threads = 1
    grinder.runs = 10

    grinder.useConsole = false
    grinder.logDirectory = log

There's not much new here.
Again, the first property informs Grinder which test script to run.
The second group of properties specifies how much load the test will utilize.
The defaults for all three properties are 1.
Our setup will run the test 10 times sequentially in a single thread.
The last properties are identical to the previous example.

Next we'll need to write the test script we just referenced.
Our `scripts/task1.py` should look something like this:

```python
from net.grinder.script.Grinder import grinder
from net.grinder.script import Test
from net.grinder.plugin.http import HTTPRequest

class TestRunner:

    def __init__(self):
        test = Test(1, "GETing some webpage")
        self.request = test.wrap(HTTPRequest())

    def __call__(self):
        self.request.GET("http://foobar.example.com/page42")
```

In the init-method we start by crating a `Test` object and then use its `wrap` method to create a proxy object wrapping an instance of `HTTPRequest`.
This proxy is then stored as an instance variable `self.request`, ready for use in the test runs.

The reason we need to use the `Test` to create a proxy is in order for Grinder to be able to track what is happening.
Every method invoked on the proxy is recorded and timed by Grinder, before passing the call on to the wrapped object or function.

In this example, the call-method simply invoks the `GET` method on the proxy, which is then passed through to the `HTTPRequest` instance performing the actual request.

If you are following along with the [workshop materials](https://github.com/kvalle/grinder-workshop), you can now run the test by using the `startAgent` script.

    ./startAgent.sh tasks/1.properties

(Or, if you checked out the code but didn't bother to do the tasks, substitute `solutions` for `tasks` and do the same.)

This should generate a few files in the `log` directory specified in the test configuration, where the results of the test are recorded.


Example 2 - Testing multiple URLs
---------------------------------

Testing the response time of a single URL isn' really very useful, so the next step is naturally to time the requests of a bunch of different URLs.

Lets say we have a file with URLs that look something like this:

    http://example.com/
    http://example.com/foo.php
    http://example.com/bar.php
    http://example.com/baz.php
    http://example.com/unreliable-link.php
    http://example.com/bad-link.php
    http://example.com/404.php

In this example we'll read this file, create a test for each URL, and "GET" it each time the script is run.

The configuration in `2.properties` is very similar to the previous example.

    grinder.script = scripts/task2-extras.py

    grinder.runs = 10
    grinder.useConsole = false
    grinder.logDirectory = log

    task2.urls = solutions/scripts/urls.txt

We reference, of course, a new script file and also add one additional parameter.
The new parameter `task2.urls` is a custom parameter which holds the path to our text file with the URLs, since this is something we really don't want to hard code into the script.

Next we implement the script as follows.

```python
from net.grinder.script.Grinder import grinder
from net.grinder.script import Test
from net.grinder.plugin.http import HTTPRequest

url_file_path = grinder.getProperties().getProperty('task2.urls')

class TestRunner:

    def __init__(self):
        url_file = open(url_file_path)
        self.tests = []
        for num, url in enumerate(url_file):
            url = url.strip()
            test = Test(num, url)
            request = test.wrap(HTTPRequest())
            self.tests.append((request, url))
        url_file.close()

    def __call__(self):
        for request, url in self.tests:
            request.GET(url)
```

Notice first how we extract custom property value as the file path in the start of the script.
The rest of the script is familiar, but with some additional logic in the `__init__` and `__call__` methods.
The code should hopefully be pretty self explanatory, but lets walk through it.

The first thing we do in the `__init__` method is to open the file with the URLs.
We then iterate through the file, using `enumerate` to get the line numbers.
For each line we extract the URL, create a `Test` object, wrap a `HTTPRequest` object using the test object, and append the wrapped request together with the URL to our list of tests.

In `__call__` we simply walk through the list of tests, making a GET request for the URL using the the corresponding wrapped HTTPRequest.

The important thing to notice in this example is that we don't simply GET all the URLs using a single HTTPRequest.
We want each URL to be timed separately, and must therefore create a grinder-proxy for each one.

Now we are ready to try it out.
Run:

    ./startAgent.sh tasks/2.properties

Which should give you something like the following included at the end of the log file:

                 Tests        Errors       Mean Test    Test Time    TPS          Mean         Response     Response     Mean time to Mean time to Mean time to
                                           Time (ms)    Standard                  response     bytes per    errors       resolve host establish    first byte   
                                                        Deviation                 length       second                                 connection                
                                                        (ms)

    Totals       70           0            130.20       143.58       1.09         2847.86      3114.11      14           15.20        52.06        119.80       



Example 3 - Validating the responses
------------------------------------

If you looked carefully at the results from the previous example, you might have discovered a problem with the test scripts we have written so far.
The *errors* column reports that everything went OK although, as we can see, there where several errors in the *response errors* column!

In this example, we'll look at how to inspect the HTTP responses, and tell Grinder to fail a test if we find anything fishy.

Again we start with the test configuration:

    grinder.script = scripts/task3.py

    grinder.runs = 10
    grinder.useConsole = false
    grinder.logDirectory = log

    task3.urls = solutions/scripts/urls.txt

Not much is changed here, so lets move on to the test script.

```python
from net.grinder.script.Grinder import grinder
from net.grinder.script import Test
from net.grinder.plugin.http import HTTPRequest

url_file_path = grinder.getProperties().getProperty('task3.urls')

class TestRunner:

    def __init__(self):
        url_file = open(url_file_path)
        self.tests = []
        for num, url in enumerate(url_file):
            url = url.strip()
            test = Test(num, url)
            request = test.wrap(HTTPRequest())
            self.tests.append((request, url))
        url_file.close()
        grinder.statistics.setDelayReports(True)

    def __call__(self):
        for request, url in self.tests:
            response = request.GET(url)
            if not self.is_valid(response):
                self.fail()
            grinder.statistics.report()

    def fail(self):
        grinder.statistics.getForLastTest().setSuccess(False)

    def is_valid(self, response):
        if len(response.getData()) < 10: return False
        if response.getStatusCode() != 200: return False
        if "epic fail" in response.getText(): return False
        else: return True
```

There are a few differences here, comprared to the last example.
Most obviously there are two new methods, but we also do some new things in the old ones.

First off, we need to tell Grinder not to automatically assume everything is okay as long as the code executes and the `GET` method returns.
We do this with the call to `grinder.statistics.setDelayReports(True)` at the end of the `__init__` method.

Next, the `__call__` method has been extended to capture the HTTP response object.
We validate the response using our new `is_valid` method, and tell Grinder to `fail` the test if validation fails.
Lastly, `grinder.statistics.report()` makes Grinder record the result of the test and move on.

The new `is_valid` method is where most of the magic happens.
Here we can look at any aspect of the response we might like, and simply return `False` if we are not satisfied.

(It would of course also be possible to make different validation checks for different URLs.
We won't go into how to do that here, but you might have a look at [this example][task-3-extras] to see how it could be done.)

By running the script we get these new results:

                 Tests        Errors       Mean Test    Test Time    TPS          Mean         Response     Response     Mean time to Mean time to Mean time to
                                           Time (ms)    Standard                  response     bytes per    errors       resolve host establish    first byte   
                                                        Deviation                 length       second                                 connection                
                                                        (ms)

Example 4 - Testing of a typical JSON-API (REST API)
----------------------------------------------------

Up until now, we have tested some pretty static pages. Now, it's time to do some more fancy parsing.

We'll be testing against an API which returns JSON-formatted data. This JSON-object will contain links to more stuff you can test against. These links will theoretically change for each request, this means that we'll have to parse the JSON to fetch the links - we can't hard-code all the links in the script beforehand.

When we do a manual call against the webpage: `http://grinder.espenhh.com/json.php`, we get some nicely formatted JSON back:

```javascript
{
   "fetched":"19.04.2012",
   "tweets":[
      {
         "user":"Espenhh",
         "tweet":"Omg, this grinder workshop is amazing",
         "profile_image":"http://grinder.espenhh.com/pics/1337.jpg"
      },
      {
         "user":"kvalle",
         "tweet":"Have you seen my new ROFL-copter? It`s kinda awesome!",
         "profile_image":"http://grinder.espenhh.com/pics/rofl.gif"
      },
      {
         "user":"Hurtigruta",
         "tweet":"I`m on a boat! Yeah!",
         "profile_image":"http://grinder.espenhh.com/pics/123.jpg"
      }
   ]
}
```

**The property file** is basically the same now as in the last three examples, the only change is that it points to the correct script.

**The script** is as usual where all the magic happens:

```python
from net.grinder.script.Grinder import grinder
from net.grinder.script import Test
from net.grinder.plugin.http import HTTPRequest
from org.json import *

class TestRunner:

    def __init__(self):
        test1 = Test(1, "GET some JSON")
        self.request1 = test1.wrap(HTTPRequest())

        test2 = Test(2, "GET profilepicture")
        self.request2 = test2.wrap(HTTPRequest())

    def __call__(self):
        # Fetches the initial JSON
        response = self.request1.GET("http://grinder.espenhh.com/json.php")
        print "JSON: " + response.getText()

        # Parses the JSON (Using a Java library). Then prints the field "fetched"
        jsonObject = JSONObject(response.text)
        fetched = jsonObject.getString("fetched")
        print "FETCHED: " + fetched

        # Gets the single tweets, and loops through them
        tweetsJsonObject = jsonObject.getJSONArray("tweets")
        for i in range(0,tweetsJsonObject.length()):
            singleTweet = tweetsJsonObject.getJSONObject(i)

            # Print out a single tweet
            userName = singleTweet.getString("user")
            tweet = singleTweet.getString("tweet")
            print "TWEET: " + userName + ": " + tweet

            # Fetch the URL to the profile picture, and GET it.
            profilePictureUri = singleTweet.getString("profile_image")
            print "GET against profile picture uri: " + profilePictureUri
            self.request2.GET(profilePictureUri)
```

First, note that we now import the package `org.json`, which is a normal Java library. Nothing fancy is going on here, we are just taking advantage of the fact that you are freely able to call Java code from your Grinder scripts. To be honest, we would probably prefer to do the JSON parsing using regular Python code, but we are here to learn you all the things about Grinder, so this time a Java-library takes the front seat.

Knowing that, the first part of the script is easy to understand. We just fetch the content of the previously mentioned link, and stores it in a variable. Then we start using the Java-library. `jsonObject = JSONObject(response.text)` parses the raw JSON from the response into a simple object we can use. We then demonstrate a few methods: `jsonObject.getString("fetched")` and `jsonObject.getJSONArray("tweets")`. It's really simple to navigate the JSON-structure doing this.

To get down to action and actually perform some more HTTP requests (that's Grinders' purpose in life, after all), we loop throuh the array of tweets, and gets the links of each tweet-authors profile picture. We then go a new `GET`-request to get this photo. Please note that we here uses the same `Test`-object for all these requests. You might wonder why we don't use a single Test-object for each and every request, because the links are different, and they are therefore different objects. That's something you just have to decide for yourself, but in our opinion, each `Test`-object should really be about a "consept", and not about a single link. Each tweet-profile-photo is different, but they are all "tweet-profile-photos", therefore they share the same `Test`-object. But, as we said, this is something you have to decide for yourself on a case-by-case-basis.

Running this script, we get the following output:

                 Tests        Errors       Mean Test    Test Time    TPS          Mean         Response     Response     Mean time to Mean time to Mean time to

                                                        (ms)                                                                                                    

    Test 1       1            0            500.00       0.00         1.31         413.00       541.28       0            381.00       421.00       489.00        "GET some JSON"
    Test 2       3            0            82.00        37.21        3.93         3806.33      14965.92     0            381.00       421.00       69.67         "GET profilepicture"

    Totals       4            0            186.50       183.85       2.62         2958.00      7753.60      0            381.00       421.00       174.50   

We here see that we are doing one GET-request to get the initial JSON, and then the loop performs three GET-requests to get the profile-pictures. By coding your tests this way (and having a good and RESTful API to test agains, which contains links), you'll be able to write small and simple tests that tests big amounts of functionality with simple code. They'll also be quite robust and won't break if you change your backend in small ways.

Example 5 - Using Grinder's TCPProxy to automatically generate tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, you don't want to write all your tests by hand, you just want to simulate a user clicking through some pages in a browser. Grinder has support for this; by using the Grinder TCPProxy you can record a web-browsing-session and replay it using Grinder afterwards. This technique will also generate a script which you can later modify (this is something you almost certainly would want to do!).

Here, we'll let you do the hard lifting yourself. Using the scripts provided in the example GIT project, do the following:

1. Start the proxy server by running the script ./startProxy.sh. This will start a simple console that lets you input comments, and stop the proxy cleanly
1. Configure your browser to send traffic through the proxy. This most likely means localhost, port 8001 â€“ the output from the first step will tell you if this is correct (read more about configuring the browser here)
1. Browse to a simple web page (we recommend starting with http://grinder.espenhh.com/simple/ ). If you browse to a complex page, the generated script will be crazy long!
1. After the page has loaded in the browser, click "stop" in the simple console window
1. Inspect the generated script: it's located at proxy/proxygeneratedscript.sh
1. Try running the script: ./startAgent.sh proxy/proxygeneratedscript.sh
1. Check the log, try modifying the script, experiment. You can start by removing all the sleep statements in the script. Then try it on a more complicated page.

As you'll see, the scripts generated using this method will be ugly as hell, and overly complex. Therefore, we really don't recommend using the Grinder TCPProxy to generate scripts which you plan to be using and maintaining in the future. But for one-time scripts, it can be quite handy.


Summary
-------

We have prestented The Grinder, as a simple tool for doing performance testing.
While there are many tools out there for testing performance, the strength of Grinder is that it is lightweight and easy to use.
We basically only needed two files and a single command to get going!

After taking you though five gradually more complex examples, we have hopefully given you some insight into how Grinder works and what it can be used for.
Now you should be ready to write some scripts of your own, and start testing *your* application!
