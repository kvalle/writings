description: "I have long been a firm believer in learning new languages. I believe that the languages we speak strongly influence how we think, and what we are able to think about. Similarly, our programming languages influence our thinking about how to solve problems. This is why I believe you need to learn new languages, and their concepts, in order to become a better programmer."
